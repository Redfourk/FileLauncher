This project is still is very early development.
Far in the future, I plan to write a proper description.

For now heres a simple overview:
This project is called FileLauncher. It's a Python-based file transfer utility with a retro style. 
Commits are structured with this format: MM.DD.YY.HH.MM (or Month.Day.Year.Hour.Minute)

That is all for now.
            .
